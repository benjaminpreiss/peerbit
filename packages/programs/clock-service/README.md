# ClockService

## ðŸš§ Experimental state ðŸš§
This module can sign entries to verify that their timestamps are set correctly.

See the [test](./src/__tests__/index.test.ts) for examples.

Nodes running this program will sign entries if their timestamp is not too far from "now". 
Hence, only use this program with an identity dedicated for this job since peers can send any entry to be signed (i.e. use dedicated nodes for this)
